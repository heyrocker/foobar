# Foobar #

Foobar is a project designed to flip open source development off its head. 

Things I don't care much about:

* Technology stack
* OOP vs procedural code
* Object models
* Rendering engines
* Performance profiling
* Frontend vs backend
* Coding style

The reason I don't care much about these things is because we are all technologists, and these are the problems we were born to solve. I have the utmost confidence that we can come together and figure out those kinds of things.

Things I care a lot about:

* Smart people
* From diverse backgrounds
* With strong vision
* Who are dedicated to treating each other with respect
* And are unwilling to accept anything less from their peers

Since these are the things I care about, I'm starting my project there. I want to collect some of these people in one place. Lets start talking in the issue queues. It doesn't even have to be about what we want to build, it can just be about whatever drives us. What our passions are. Lets bond as humans first, build a community, and then figure out what we want to build afterwards. 

Foobar is the realization of this:

I don't know what we're going to build yet, what else was I supposed to call it?

# Code Of Conduct #

We will need one. This is, to me, the most important part of the project. It defines how we treat each other, which is *what this entire project is all about*. I've been recently throwing around mentally the idea that all open source projects should have the equivalent of an HR department.

I also recently saw a Twitter thread from Isaac Z. Schlueter which I thought provided a really nice outline of the behavior they accept in the #nodejs IRC channel (https://twitter.com/izs/status/517217340191027200).

# Leadership #
Greg Dunlap is the BDFL of the Foobar project. As the project grows an explicit organizational structure will be developed to manage such growth. The conecptual goal will be to match the principles of democratic structuring as defined by Jo Freeman in her paper [The Tyranny Of Structurelessness](http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm) except in as much as this conflicts with the whole concept of a BDFL.

# License #
No idea. TBD. Might need a new one.
